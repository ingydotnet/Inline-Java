0.53  Sun Jan  9 08:15:06 EST 2011

      It can still be enabled manually using the BUILD_PERL_NATIVES build configuration 
      option.

      since it was not portable

0.46  Web Feb 04 20:00:00 EST 2004
    - Fixed Natives.xs to work with ExtUtils::ParseXS

    - Added PRIVATE mode for use with SHARED_JVM
    - Added DEBUGGER mode that launches jdb
    - Fixed memory leak in JNI code (patch submitted by Dave Blob)

0.43  Tue Oct 14 13:18:25 EDT 2003
    - Restored $VERSION in each .pm file
    - Inline::Java now formerly requires Perl 5.6

0.42  Fri Sep  5 13:18:25 EDT 2003
    - Fixed more CLASSPATH issues. CLASSPATH now works like this:
      * CLASSPATH environment variable is global
      * CLASSPATH configuration option is local to the user class loader
    - Added method cache to increase performance and decrease reflection 
      API calls
    - Altered and documented the study_classes() function
    - Added EXTRA_JAVA_ARGS and EXTRA_JAVAC_ARGS config options

0.41  Mon Jul 14 13:18:25 EDT 2003
    - Fixed CLASSPATH bug
    - Possibly (!) fixed test suite problems under heavy load

0.40  Fri Apr 11 11:00:00 EST 2003
    - Patch by Doug MacEachern to allow running under servlet engines.
    - Patch by John Kinsley for handling empty arrays.
    - Custom ClassLoader allows for better isolation of user code and
      dynamic 'CLASSPATH' (multiple sections/clients are now totally
      independant).
    - Core Java code is now compiled separately (at install time) instead
      of with the user code (for each script). This dramatically improves
      build time.
    - Default port number changed to 0 (next available port number). 
      This allows many multiple users to run concurrently without 
      clashes.
      Note: The default port on systems where this feature is not 
            available has remained 7890.
      Note: The default port for SHARED_JVM mode is now 7891.
    - SHARED_JVM mode now calls release_JVM() automatically.
    - UTF8 support
    - User code can now be a public class and (optionally) inside a package.
    - Callback classes have changed.
      Note: These classes are now in the org.perl.inline.java package.
      Note: PerlException has been renamed InlineJavaPerlException.
      Note: If you presently use callbacks, your code may now no longer compile.
            You will need to apply the changes listed above to fix it.
    - study_classes now returns the package in which the studied classes
	  have been put.
    - Many bug fixes and documentation corrections.

      a java.lang.Double on the Java side.

    - Added 'studying' of external Java classes
    - Added support for default no-arg constructors for public classes
    - Caching for class information
